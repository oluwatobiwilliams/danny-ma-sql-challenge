/*
1. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

Convert the week_date to a DATE format

Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

segment	age_band
1	Young Adults
2	Middle Aged
3 or 4	Retirees
Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
segment	demographic
C	Couples
F	Families
Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
